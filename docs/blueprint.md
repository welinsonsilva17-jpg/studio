# **App Name**: Gerador Docs

## Core Features:

- Query Execution: Parse and execute DOS commands entered by the user, showing their output, leveraging a LLM tool to map the commands to OS equivalents
- Command Suggestions: Suggest possible DOS commands based on user input using AI to improve user experience and guide users.
- File Navigation: Allow users to navigate a virtual file system using DOS-like commands (cd, dir).
- Text Editor: Integrate a basic text editor (like EDIT) for creating and modifying files within the app.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Sky blue (#87CEEB) to suggest clarity and a vintage feel.
- Background color: Light grayish-blue (#D0DDE2) to keep a focus on readability.
- Accent color: A vivid sea-foam green (#7FFFD4) to call attention to active interface elements.
- Font: 'Source Code Pro', monospace, is a suitable choice given the likely need to present some amount of computer code to the user.
- Mimic a DOS-like interface with a command prompt and text-based display.
- Minimalistic icons to represent directories and files.
- Simple animations for directory navigation.
